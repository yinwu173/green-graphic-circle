# SVG Logo Maker 

## About the Project

* This project allows us to become freelance web developers, enabling us to generate a simple log for any project they may come across. It enables us to become our own graphic designers. 

## Acceptance Criteria

* WHEN I am prompted for text, THEN I can enter up to three characters
* WHEN I am prompted for the text color, THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
* WHEN I am prompted for a shape, THEN I am presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square
* WHEN I am prompted for the shape's color, THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
* WHEN I have entered input for all the prompts, THEN an SVG file is created named logo.svg AND the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line
* WHEN I open the logo.svg file in a browser, THEN I am shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria I entered

## Installation

* Clone the repo. Install node packages in the terminal. Then, run the command to install inquirer and jest dependencies.

### Hints

* First, we need to install packages using npm init -y then npm i. Make sure to use gitignore so that it doesn't track the node modules.
